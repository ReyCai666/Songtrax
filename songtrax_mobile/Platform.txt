My Platform: iOS

Note that I have removed the songtrax_mobile/ios/Pods folder suggested by a tutor Alex (detail on ed private post #798) because it was too large, node_modules is also removed, so please run `pod install` before marking, sorry for any inconvenience.
 
I am developing with pure react native, NOT EXPO. 

To help you mark, here are some points on the map you can test with:

Your current starting point:
Within circle and have songs: -27.4959128036638130    153.0136956701559500

Others:
Within circle but does not have song: -27.50193288155433   153.006188481462

Within circle and have song: -27.4979522415886900    153.0180059259738500

Outside circle: -27.49763627229212     153.02271460802842


sometimes on the profile page, if the keyboard is not popping up itself, you can press cmd + k to manually pop up.
Sometimes if the play music button does not make any sound, you can fix this by click on the simulator (iPhone SE) side mute button.


Thank you very much for your time :)
